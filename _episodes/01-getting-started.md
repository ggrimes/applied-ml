## Rule-based programming

We are all familiar with the idea of applying rules to data to gain insights and make decisions. For example, we learn that the normal body temperature is ~37 Â°C (~98.5 Â°F), and that higher or lower temperatures can be cause for concern.

As programmers we understand how to codify these rules. If we were developing software for a hospital to flag patients at risk of deterioration, we might create early-warning rules such as those below:

```python
def has_fever(temp_c):
    if temp_c > 38:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
