## Test/Train Split

Creating a model is all well and good, but how do we know that it is actually going to be useful in the real world? Essentially, we are asking how well does our model generalise to new data? To get an estimate of this, we can split our data into two sets: a training set and a test set. We can then train our model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set. This is known as the test/train split.

> Discuss in small groups what proportion of data should be used for training. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using more or less data for training? If you have a lot of data, is it better to use more or less for training?
